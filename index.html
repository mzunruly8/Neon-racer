I apologize for that. It seems I didn't provide the code in the chat yet. Let me correct that now: ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Neon Racer</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
<script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
You should see the code in the chat now, ready for you to copy.
